# Appendix E: Enterprise Document Management and Multi-Project Composition

## E.1 Overview

When multiple projects consume shared authoritative documents from various organizational hierarchies, the framework extends to support enterprise-scale document management. This appendix describes patterns for versioning, publishing, dependency management, and formal composition of documents across organizational boundaries.

### E.1.1 Core Concepts

• **Document as Code Philosophy**: Authoritative documents are treated as versioned, immutable artifacts with explicit dependencies, similar to software libraries. Each document has a manifest, version number, and defined interfaces (what constraints it provides).

• **Multi-Source Composition**: Projects rarely depend on a single authoritative source. Legal requirements, enterprise standards, divisional policies, and external regulations must be composed into project-specific interpretations. The pullback mechanism provides formal resolution when sources conflict.

• **Dependency Graph Management**: Just as software projects declare library dependencies, projects declare document dependencies. This enables impact analysis, version control, and reproducible builds of document sets.

• **Publishing Pipeline**: Documents move through draft, review, approval, and publishing stages. Once published, versions are immutable. Changes require new versions with explicit deprecation of old versions.

## E.2 Enterprise Repository Structure

### E.2.1 Hierarchical Organization

The enterprise document repository organizes all authoritative documents by ownership hierarchy:

• **Published Directory**: Contains only immutable, approved versions of documents. This is the authoritative source for all projects.

• **Organizational Hierarchy**:
  - Corporate level: Legal, HR, IT, Enterprise Architecture
  - Divisional level: Business unit specific policies and requirements  
  - External sources: Regulations, industry standards, vendor specifications

• **Version Directories**: Each document has separate directories for each published version, preventing accidental modifications to historical versions

• **Latest Symlinks**: Convenience pointers to current versions, but projects should reference specific versions for reproducibility

### E.2.2 Document Package Structure

Each published document version contains:

• **document.yaml**: Manifest file declaring metadata, dependencies, and what the document provides
• **Content files**: The actual document content in markdown, YAML, or other structured formats
• **constraints.yaml**: Formal declaration of requirements and constraints this document imposes
• **schemas/**: Validation schemas for any structured data the document defines
• **examples/**: Reference examples showing correct application of the document's requirements
• **migration/**: Guides for moving from previous versions

### E.2.3 Versioning Strategies

Different document types require different versioning approaches:

• **Internal Documents**: Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
  - MAJOR: Breaking changes requiring consumer updates
  - MINOR: New requirements or sections that don't break existing compliance
  - PATCH: Clarifications, typo fixes, examples

• **External Regulations**: Use year-based versioning (YYYY.REVISION)
  - Reflects the reality that regulations update annually or by amendment
  - Revision number for mid-year updates or corrections

• **Industry Standards**: Often have their own versioning schemes
  - Preserve the original version identifier for traceability
  - Add metadata for internal tracking

## E.3 Dependency Management System

### E.3.1 Project Dependency Declaration

Projects declare document dependencies in a structured manifest file that specifies:

• **Required Documents**: Which documents the project must comply with, including version constraints
• **Version Constraints**: Acceptable version ranges using operators like:
  - Exact match: "2.1.0"
  - Compatible versions: "^2.1.0" (2.x.x)
  - Patch updates only: "~2.1.0" (2.1.x)
  - Ranges: ">=2.0.0 <3.0.0"

• **Resolution Strategy**: How to handle multiple valid versions or conflicts
• **Overrides**: Force specific versions despite dependency calculations
• **Exclusions**: Explicitly exclude certain documents or patterns

### E.3.2 Document Manifest Specification

Each published document includes a manifest declaring:

• **Identity**: Name, version, type, publisher, publication date
• **Dependencies**: Other documents this document depends on
• **Provides**: What constraints, definitions, or requirements this document supplies
• **Deprecation**: Information about deprecated versions and migration paths
• **Breaking Changes**: List of changes that require consumer updates
• **Validation Rules**: How to validate correct application of this document

### E.3.3 Dependency Resolution Process

The system resolves dependencies through:

• **Transitive Dependency Discovery**: Automatically find all documents referenced by your direct dependencies
• **Version Constraint Solving**: Find the set of versions that satisfies all constraints
• **Conflict Detection**: Identify when constraints cannot be simultaneously satisfied
• **Lock File Generation**: Record exact resolved versions for reproducible builds
• **Update Management**: Controlled updates with impact analysis

## E.4 Pullback Implementation for Composition

### E.4.1 Multi-Source Conflict Resolution

When multiple authoritative sources provide conflicting requirements:

• **Conflict Identification**: Systematically detect when different sources specify incompatible constraints
• **Common Abstraction Discovery**: Find the higher-level goal that all sources are trying to achieve
• **Resolution Strategies**:
  - Maximum constraint: Apply the most restrictive requirement
  - Layered approach: Apply different rules at different layers
  - Temporal resolution: Time-based or context-based rule selection
  - Weighted composition: Priority-based resolution

• **Validation**: Ensure the resolution satisfies all source requirements to the maximum extent possible
• **Documentation**: Record the resolution rationale and trade-offs

### E.4.2 Composition Patterns

Common patterns for resolving multi-source requirements:

• **Regulatory Hierarchy**: External regulations override internal policies
• **Specificity Precedence**: More specific requirements override general ones
• **Time-Based Precedence**: Newer requirements supersede older ones
• **Context-Aware Composition**: Different rules for different scenarios
• **Additive Composition**: Combine non-conflicting requirements

### E.4.3 Composition Artifacts

The composition process produces:

• **Unified Requirement Documents**: Consolidated requirements with conflict resolutions
• **Resolution Records**: Documentation of how conflicts were resolved
• **Traceability Matrix**: Links from composed requirements back to all sources
• **Validation Test Suite**: Tests confirming the composition satisfies all sources
• **Impact Analysis**: What changed from previous compositions

## E.5 Implementation Approaches

### E.5.1 Document Storage Strategies

Options for managing enterprise documents in projects:

• **Symbolic Links**:
  - Link to centrally published documents
  - Pros: Simple, always current
  - Cons: Platform dependent, no version control

• **Git Submodules**:
  - Include document repositories as submodules
  - Pros: Version controlled, portable
  - Cons: Complex with many dependencies

• **Package Management Approach**:
  - Tool-managed dependency resolution and fetching
  - Pros: Automated, handles transitive dependencies
  - Cons: Requires tooling infrastructure

• **Copy and Track**:
  - Copy specific versions into project
  - Pros: Self-contained, simple
  - Cons: Manual updates, storage duplication

### E.5.2 Tooling Requirements

Document management tools should provide:

• **Dependency Resolution**: Calculate valid version sets from constraints
• **Fetching**: Retrieve specific document versions from repository
• **Validation**: Verify document integrity and constraint satisfaction
• **Composition**: Apply pullback resolutions to merge requirements
• **Update Management**: Check for updates and assess impact
• **Traceability**: Generate reports showing document relationships
• **Publishing**: Package and publish new document versions

### E.5.3 Integration Patterns

Patterns for integrating with the single-project structure:

• **Source Materials**: Dependencies go in /00-source-materials/
• **Composition Results**: Pullback resolutions go in /06-transformation-metadata/
• **Layer Mapping**: Enterprise documents map to appropriate semantic layers
• **Validation Integration**: Document constraints become quality gates
• **CI/CD Integration**: Automated checking of document compliance

## E.6 Publishing and Lifecycle Management

### E.6.1 Document States and Workflow

Documents progress through defined states:

• **Draft**: Work in progress, not referenceable
• **Review**: Under formal review process
• **Approved**: Approved but not yet effective
• **Published**: Available for use as dependency
• **Deprecated**: Marked for future removal
• **Archived**: No longer active but preserved

### E.6.2 Publishing Requirements

Before publishing a new version:

• **Validation**: Document passes all structural and content validation
• **Dependency Check**: All document dependencies are satisfied
• **Impact Analysis**: Assess impact on dependent documents
• **Approval Records**: Required approvals are documented
• **Migration Guide**: For breaking changes, guide consumers on updating

### E.6.3 Deprecation Process

When deprecating document versions:

• **Advance Notice**: Minimum notice period before removal
• **Migration Support**: Clear guidance on moving to new versions
• **Dependent Notification**: Alert all consumers of the deprecation
• **Grace Period**: Time allowed before enforcement
• **Sunset Date**: Final date when version becomes invalid

## E.7 Practical Implementation Guidelines
