    Refactor the C4H Editor frontend codebase to resolve TypeScript errors, fix layout issues, 
    improve component architecture, and ensure adherence to the agent design principles.
    
    Read the documents in the doc folder to understand the backend service that the editor provides functionality over
    Specifically, read the WorkOrder_Design_Guide the purpose of the editor is to create and config and manage work orders

    Goal:
    Create a stable, error-free frontend application with proper TypeScript integration, 
    consistent UI framework usage, and a fixed layout where the sidebar doesn't obscure the main content.
    
    Required Changes:
    1. Fix missing TypeScript files and references
    2. Resolve dependency and type declaration issues
    3. Address React scope and JSX errors
    4. Fix the sidebar layout issue that obscures the main content
    5. Clean up unused imports and variables
    6. Standardize UI framework usage (choose either Material UI or Chakra UI)
    7. Improve API configuration management
    
    Specific Errors to Fix:
    - Missing TypeScript files: Multiple errors indicate files not found but referenced in tsconfig.json
      * Missing PromptEditor/* components (ParameterPanel.tsx, PromptEditor.tsx, TestRunner.tsx, VersionControl.tsx)
      * Missing PromptLibrary/PromptLibrary.tsx
      * Missing common components (DiffViewer.tsx, TimeAgo.tsx)
      * Missing hooks and types (usePromptApi.ts, prompt.ts)
    
    - Missing tsconfig.node.json file referenced in main tsconfig.json
    
    - Missing type declarations: Cannot find module errors for:
      * 'react', 'react-dom/client', 'react-router-dom'
      * '@mui/material', '@mui/icons-material'
      * 'axios'
      * './types/job' and other local imports
    
    - React scope issues: Multiple "This JSX tag requires 'React' to be in scope" errors
    
    - Unused imports: Multiple "is declared but its value is never read" warnings
    
    - Layout issue: Sidebar is hiding the main screen, main screen needs to be scaled so it's visible
    
    Implementation Requirements:
    - Restore or recreate all missing TypeScript files
    - Update package.json with required dependencies
    - Create valid tsconfig.node.json file
    - Fix React imports for JSX components
    - Modify layout CSS to prevent sidebar overlap - update Navigation.tsx to adjust its width, position and z-index
    - Remove unused imports and variables
    - Choose one primary UI framework (recommend using Material UI as it's more prevalent in the codebase)
    - Create a centralized API configuration module
    
    Design Principles to Follow:
    - Single Responsibility: Each component has one clear, focused task
    - Minimal Agent Logic: Keep component code focused on infrastructure concerns
    - Template Configuration Over Code: Move configuration to external files
    - Clear Component Boundaries: Well-defined interfaces between components
    - Explicit Over Implicit: Clear props and state management
    - Logging for Visibility: Debug logging at key points
    
    Files to Modify:
    - Missing TypeScript files identified in error logs
    - tsconfig.json and tsconfig.node.json
    - component files with React scope issues
    - Navigation.tsx and related layout components
    - API hook files (usePromptApi.ts, useJobApi.ts, useWorkOrderApi.ts)
