    Fix the inconsistency between direct workflow execution and API service execution by ensuring the Orchestrator reloads teams when configuration changes.
    
    The current issue is:
    1. In direct workflow mode, teams are created with complete configuration
    2. In API mode, teams are created once at startup with empty configuration and never refreshed
    3. This causes tartxt_config to be empty in API mode, resulting in "No input paths configured" errors
    
    Required changes:
    
    1. Modify Orchestrator.execute_workflow() in c4h_services/src/orchestration/orchestrator.py:
       - Add code at the beginning to check if context["config"] differs from self.config
       - If different, update self.config with context["config"]
       - Recreate self.config_node = create_config_node(self.config)
       - Clear and reload teams (self.teams = {} followed by self._load_teams())
       - Add a log message: "orchestrator.teams_reloaded_with_updated_config"
    
    2. Update API service.py run_workflow handler:
       - Ensure the full prepared_config is included in the context as context["config"]
       - This is critical to trigger the team reload mechanism in execute_workflow
    
    The changes must be minimal and focused on ensuring the Orchestrator reloads teams when configuration changes. No changes to the initialize_workflow function or other parts of the codebase are needed.
    
    Implementation Notes:
    - Add the config check logic at the very beginning of execute_workflow before any other processing
    - Use deep comparison of configs to avoid unnecessary reloads
    - Ensure API handler includes prepared_config in context
    - Maintain all existing functionality in both methods
