    Refactor the codebase to remove legacy direct workflow implementation in favor of team-based orchestration:
    
    The following changes are recommended to refactor the existing codebase, but reevaluate as needed:

    1. Remove the static workflow implementation in `c4h_services/src/intent/impl/prefect/workflows.py` 
    2. Update all dependent components to use team-based orchestration exclusively
    3. Update `c4h_services/src/intent/impl/prefect/flows.py` to be a thin wrapper around team orchestration
    4. Ensure backward compatibility with existing API endpoints
    5. Simplify configuration handling to focus on team-based execution
    6. Clean up all direct references to the legacy workflow pattern
    7. Update the service implementation to only use team-based execution
    8. Consolidate runner code to remove workflow-specific logic
    
    
    The implementation should respect:
    
    1. Agent Design Principles (from Agent_Design_Principles.md):
      - LLM-First Processing: Keep agent code focused on infrastructure
      - Single Responsibility: Each component has one clear task
      - Clear Boundaries: Team, Agent, and Orchestrator responsibilities clearly defined
      - Minimal Processing: Pass data through to LLM without unnecessary transformation
      - Observable Behavior: Maintain extensive logging and artifact tracking
      - Stateless Operation: Agents don't maintain state between operations
      - Composability: Agents can be chained together
    
    2. Config Design Principles (from Config_Design_Principles.md):
      - Hierarchical Configuration: Follow strict hierarchy for all config
      - Smart Merge Behavior: Base config provides foundation, override config adds/updates
      - Separation of Responsibilities: Each component owns its config section
      - Config Location: Clear hierarchical paths
      - Config Access: Agents access only their own config section
    
    All changes should maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality while adding the new team-based capabilities. The system should be designed to allow gradual migration from the current static workflow to the new team-based approach.
