intent:
  description: |
    Enhance prefect_runner to support an API service mode while leveraging native Prefect capabilities and existing libraries.
    prefect runner will support existing workflow mode
    and new -S for service mode, -P for explicit port otherwise next available port 

    Service mode will behave just like a workflow except that all configuration and project handling will be done via API calls.

    All designs must be constrained by the existing c4h_services design patterns and requirements - read the design principles in the docs folder.

    2. File Organization:
        - All new files must be in c4h_services/src/api
        - Use existing patterns for file organization
        - Use existing patterns for file naming
        - Use existing patterns for file content

    Design Requirements:
    - Design must comply with docs/Agent_Design_Principles.md
    - Config design must comply with docs/Config_Design_Principles.md
    - All imports must follow c4h_agents import patterns
    - All new code must use absolute imports

    Implementation Requirements:

    3. API Endpoints:
        POST /api/v1/workflow:
          Request:
            - system_config: Dict
            - app_config: Dict (optional)
            - project_path: str
            - intent: Dict
          Response:
            - workflow_id: str
            - status: str
            - storage_path: Optional[str]

        GET /api/v1/workflow/{workflow_id}:
          Response:
            - status: str
            - stages: Dict
            - events: List[Dict]
            - storage_path: Optional[str]

    Integration Requirements:
    - Use config.deep_merge for configs
    - Use Project model for projects
    - Use existing storage patterns
    - Maintain workflow patterns
    - Use existing logging

    Constraints:
    - No changes to c4h_agents
    - No relative imports
    - No security yet
    - No new config patterns
    - Preserve CLI functionality
    - Minimize new code

    DO NOT CREATE NEW FILES UNLESS REQUIRED, USE EXISTING PATTERNS AND FILES

    DO NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES UNLESS YOU HAVE READ THE DESIGN PRINCIPLES AND UNDERSTAND THE REQUIREMENTS AND CHANGES ARE REQUIRED
