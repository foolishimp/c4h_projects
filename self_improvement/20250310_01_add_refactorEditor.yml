  description: |
    Complete the frontend implementation for the C4H Editor to fully support WorkOrder management and 
    C4H service integration, building on the existing backend changes.
    
    The implementation will:
    - Create frontend components for WorkOrder editing and management
    - Implement job tracking and status visualization
    - Add submission functionality for work orders to the C4H service
    - Integrate with existing Prompt functionality while maintaining backward compatibility
    
    Implementation requirements:
    1. WorkOrder Editing:
       - Extend existing PromptEditor with WorkOrder-specific fields
       - Add YAML configuration editing support
       - Implement conversion from Prompts to WorkOrders
       
    2. Job Management:
       - Create job listing view with filtering and sorting
       - Implement job details view with status tracking
       - Add job action controls (submit, cancel, retry)
       - Implement real-time status updates
       
    3. Navigation & Integration:
       - Add routes for job and work order screens
       - Create navigation links between components
       - Implement submission flow from WorkOrder to Job
       - Maintain backward compatibility with prompt functionality
       
    4. API Integration:
       - Connect frontend to existing job API endpoints
       - Implement hooks for work order and job operations
       - Add proper loading states and error handling
       - Support real-time status checking
       
    Follow the project's design principles of template configuration over code, clear component 
    boundaries, and minimal agent logic. Ensure consistent error handling and logging patterns.
