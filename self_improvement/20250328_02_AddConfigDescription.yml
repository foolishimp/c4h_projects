# C4H Editor - Save & Load Config Description
# Project settings
project:
  path: "/Users/jim/src/apps/c4h_editor/"
  workspace_root: "workspaces"

intent:
  description: |
      GOAL: The Config Description filed is not displaying on the Config List Screen
      -  The Config Description is being saved into the repository, so the problem is not on the write
      - The problem is reading the Config discription and showing it on the config List screen, 
      - making sure it's visible on the Config Editor screen and editable.
      - That it's first Config ID, the Config Description, then Config Editor

      CONTEXT: Read the editor generic config, config service API & TypeScript design principles for context.
      
      APPROACH:
      1. Trace the complete data flow for description fields from UI → API → Backend → Storage → API → UI
      2. Identify ALL potential failure points across the entire stack
      3. Fix EACH component ensuring correct handling of the description field
      4. Document your complete investigation and append to the ChangeLog.md
      
      DELIVERABLES:
      1. ALL modified files in the correct format for processing
      1a. On the Config Editor, the Config ID must be above the Description Text Box
      2. Append to the ChagneLog.md a comprehensive description in the project folder documenting:
        - Problem description and impact
        - All files refactored and the changes made to each file
      
      PROBLEM:
      When creating a Config, the Config Editor screen allows me to enter a description.
      When I go back to edit the Config, I cannot see the description field.
      When I look at the Config Browser, the description field shows "No Description".
      Which leads me to believe the description may not be getting saved or loaded correctly.

      Examine the ENTIRE workflow including server response. Don't focus only on a single file.
      Assume the backend might be working correctly - validate with the provided logs.
