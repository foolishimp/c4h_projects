    Refactor the C4H Editor to support WorkOrder management and C4H service integration while maintaining existing functionality.
    
    The refactoring will:
    - Keep Git-based prompt management (existing functionality)
    - Transform prompts to work orders with additional fields
    - Add service integration for submitting work orders as jobs
    - Add job tracking and status management
    - Provide a job history view
    
    Implementation requirements:
    1. Model Changes:
       - Extend Prompt model to WorkOrder with fields for asset, intent, goal
       - Create Job model for tracking submissions to C4H service
       - Maintain backwards compatibility with existing prompts
       
    2. Backend Enhancements:
       - Create C4H service client for API integration
       - Add job repository for tracking submissions
       - Extend prompt repository to support work orders
       - Add API endpoints for job management
       
    3. Frontend Enhancements:
       - Add WorkOrder specialized editing with YAML support
       - Create job listing and details views
       - Add submission functionality to editors
       - Add navigation between components
       
    4. Simplifications:
       - Use a single configuration file rather than parameterization
       - Focus on core submission and status checking
       - Skip workflow management features
       
    Maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality.
    Follow the project's design principles of template configuration over code and clear component boundaries.
    Use consistent error handling and logging patterns throughout.
