# Intent Service Migration Design

## Overview

Transform the current agent-based refactoring system into a service-oriented architecture using Prefect for workflow orchestration while maintaining agent autonomy and existing functionality.

## Core Design Principles

1. Agents remain independent, unaware of orchestration
2. Prefect handles workflow coordination and state
3. Service-first architecture with API access
4. Maintain existing agent interfaces and responsibilities
5. Enable monitoring and observability

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Core Workflow Migration
**Goal**: Basic Prefect integration without disrupting current functionality

1. Create Generic Agent Task Wrapper
   - Wrap agents in Prefect tasks without modifying them
   - Implement retry and error handling
   - Maintain agent interface consistency

2. Implement Main Workflow
   - Convert IntentAgent orchestration to Prefect flow
   - Set up proper task dependencies
   - Add basic logging and monitoring

3. State Management Migration
   - Adapt WorkflowState for Prefect persistence
   - Implement state serialization
   - Set up state transitions between tasks

### Phase 2: Service Infrastructure
**Goal**: Deploy as a proper service with monitoring

1. Service Configuration
   - Docker container setup
   - Environment configuration
   - Resource management settings

2. Deployment Setup
   - Production deployment configuration
   - Development environment setup
   - Work queue configuration
   - Health monitoring

3. Observability Implementation
   - Logging infrastructure
   - Metrics collection
   - Tracing setup
   - Alert configuration

### Phase 3: Internal Workflow Optimization
**Goal**: Enhanced orchestration for complex agents

1. Coder Agent Enhancement
   - Subflow for semantic iteration
   - Asset management orchestration
   - Progress tracking
   - Failure recovery

2. Task Optimization
   - Caching strategy
   - Resource allocation
   - Performance monitoring
   - Batch processing capability

### Phase 4: Client Interface
**Goal**: Enable service access and monitoring

1. API Layer
   - REST API endpoints
   - Authentication/Authorization
   - Rate limiting
   - API documentation

2. Monitoring Interface
   - Prefect UI integration
   - Custom dashboard requirements
   - Status reporting
   - Audit logging

## Technical Components

### Core Services
1. **Intent Service**
   - Prefect workflow engine
   - Agent task management
   - State persistence
   - Error handling

2. **Agent Task Wrapper**
   ```python
   @dataclass
   class AgentTaskConfig:
       agent_class: Type[BaseAgent]
       config: Dict[str, Any]
       requires_approval: bool
       max_retries: int
   ```

3. **Workflow State Management**
   - Prefect state persistence
   - Task result storage
   - State transition tracking
   - Recovery mechanisms

### Infrastructure
1. **Deployment Configuration**
   - Docker containers
   - Environment settings
   - Resource limits
   - Scaling rules

2. **Monitoring Stack**
   - Logging aggregation
   - Metrics collection
   - Tracing system
   - Alert management

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Must Have - Phase 1**
   - Basic Prefect workflow
   - Agent task wrapper
   - State persistence
   - Error handling

2. **Should Have - Phase 2**
   - Service deployment
   - Basic monitoring
   - Development environment
   - Documentation

3. **Could Have - Phase 3**
   - Advanced orchestration
   - Performance optimization
   - Enhanced monitoring
   - Custom dashboards

4. **Won't Have Initially**
   - Complex custom UI
   - Advanced analytics
   - Multi-tenant support
   - Custom scheduling

## Migration Strategy

1. **Preparation**
   - Set up Prefect development environment
   - Create test workflows
   - Establish monitoring baseline
   - Document current state

2. **Implementation**
   - Start with core workflow
   - Add services incrementally
   - Test thoroughly
   - Deploy gradually

3. **Validation**
   - Compare with existing system
   - Verify all functionality
   - Performance testing
   - Security review

## Success Criteria

1. All existing functionality preserved
2. Improved monitoring and observability
3. Service can be deployed and scaled
4. State management is reliable
5. API access is secure and efficient

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **Risk**: Complex state management
   - *Mitigation*: Thorough testing of state transitions
   - *Mitigation*: Backup state persistence

2. **Risk**: Performance overhead
   - *Mitigation*: Careful resource allocation
   - *Mitigation*: Performance monitoring

3. **Risk**: Service reliability
   - *Mitigation*: Proper error handling
   - *Mitigation*: Automated recovery

4. **Risk**: Migration disruption
   - *Mitigation*: Phased approach
   - *Mitigation*: Parallel running capability

## Next Steps

1. Set up development environment with Prefect
2. Create prototype of agent task wrapper
3. Implement basic workflow
4. Test state management
5. Plan deployment structure
