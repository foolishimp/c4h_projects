- Major financial institutions use Python for quantitative research, risk management, and regulatory compliance
- Provides full programming language capabilities essential for complex mathematical models
- Extensive ecosystem including NumPy, Pandas, and specialized packages for quantitative finance
- Enables implementation of sophisticated algorithms required by Basel III and CCAR
- Natural fit for teams already using Python for risk modeling and analytics

**DBT: SQL Transformation Framework**
- Designed for ETL/ELT workflows, not computational workloads
- Primarily used in financial services for basic reporting and data warehouse management
- Template-based approach using SQL and Jinja
- Excellent for standardized transformations but fundamentally unable to implement Basel III mathematical models
- Cannot perform the complex calculations required for risk-weighted assets, CVA, or other regulatory metrics
- No evidence of adoption for regulatory calculations in any major financial institution

The talent pool reality strongly favors Python: financial institutions employ thousands of Python developers for quantitative work, while DBT expertise centers around data engineering and analytics engineering roles. Python is widely used in quantitative finance for complex calculations and risk management. For regulatory calculation teams specifically, Python skills are the industry standard—every major bank's quantitative teams use Python as their primary language.

### Row-Level Tracing: Beyond Compliance to Competitive Advantage

While CCAR mandates attribute-level lineage, our platform's row-level tracing capability represents a strategic differentiator that:

1. **Anticipates Future Regulations**: Regulatory requirements consistently evolve toward greater granularity and transparency. Row-level tracing positions us ahead of this curve.

2. **Enables SME Autonomy**: When business users directly build calculations, they need granular visibility to:
   - Validate their logic works correctly
   - Understand calculation behavior on specific cases
   - Make targeted adjustments with confidence
   - Debug edge cases independently

3. **Provides LLM Assurance**: As AI generates increasingly complex calculations:
   - Row-level tracing becomes **mandatory** for trust and validation
   - SMEs can verify AI-generated logic on actual data points
   - Immediate feedback loops improve LLM outputs
   - Granular audit trails satisfy both regulatory and risk management needs

4. **Supports Real-Time Adjustments**: Organizations can:
   - Trace the impact of changes at individual record level
   - Quickly identify and correct calculation errors
   - Provide detailed explanations to regulators
   - Maintain confidence in rapidly evolving calculations

**PySpark + LLM Integration**:
- SMEs interact directly: "Create Basel III calculation with SME adjustment"
- AI generates code within existing wrapper framework
- **Row-level tracing provides mandatory validation** of AI-generated logic
- SMEs verify calculations work correctly on specific data points
- Immediate feedback loops improve LLM accuracy for regulatory domain
- Technical team focuses on platform capabilities, not calculation debugging

**DBT + LLM Challenges**:
- Jinja templating complicates AI code generation
- Technical review still required for all changes

## Conclusion

The assessment clearly demonstrates that the current PySpark platform provides superior value across all critical dimensions. The fundamental mismatch between DBT's SQL transformation capabilities and the mathematical requirements of regulatory calculations makes migration technically inappropriate, not merely inadvisable.

Python has established itself as the industry standard for financial calculations, with every major financial institution using it for risk management and regulatory compliance. Our platform leverages this ecosystem while adding competitive advantages through row-level tracing and mixed-squad enablement.

Beyond meeting CCAR's attribute-level lineage requirements, the platform's row-level tracing capability represents a strategic investment in:

- **Regulatory Future-Proofing**: Anticipating the inevitable evolution toward more granular requirements
- **SME Empowerment**: Providing the assurance needed for direct business user control
- **AI Readiness**: Enabling mandatory validation for LLM-generated calculations
- **Competitive Differentiation**: Offering capabilities that exceed industry standards

The mixed-squad operational model this platform enables represents genuine organizational innovation. In an era where AI will increasingly generate complex calculations, row-level tracing transforms from a "nice-to-have" to an essential trust mechanism.

While DBT excels at SQL-based data transformations, adopting it for regulatory calculations would:
- Fail to support the complex mathematical models these calculations require
- Meet only minimum regulatory requirements without future-proofing
- Eliminate the row-level assurance critical for LLM adoption
- Reduce organizational agility and innovation
- Remove established competitive advantages
- Require significant investment to achieve inferior capabilities

The recommended enhancement path preserves these strategic advantages while addressing modernization needs through targeted improvements. This approach positions the organization for continued leadership in regulatory technology innovation, particularly as AI transforms how calculations are created and validated.
