- Provides attribute-level lineage capabilities through various tools
- Strong community and vendor support
- Template-based approach using SQL and Jinja
- Well-suited for standard reporting and data transformations

However, introducing DBT alongside our existing PySpark platform would:
- Fragment the architecture into two separate technology stacks
- Require maintaining different deployment, monitoring, and debugging approaches
- Split team expertise and knowledge
- Create gaps in our row-level lineage coverage
- Add operational complexity without providing capabilities we lack

Given our significant investment in the PySpark platform with wrapped operators, maintaining architectural consistency provides greater value than introducing technology diversity.

### Row-Level Tracing: Beyond Compliance to Competitive Advantage

While both platforms can meet CCAR's attribute-level lineage requirements, our platform's row-level tracing capability represents a strategic differentiator that:

1. **Exceeds Regulatory Requirements**: While attribute-level lineage satisfies CCAR, row-level tracing provides granular visibility that:
   - Shows exactly which rows contributed to each calculated value
   - Enables precise debugging of calculation issues
   - Provides complete audit trails for regulatory inquiries
   - Positions us ahead of evolving regulatory requirements

2. **Enables SME Autonomy**: When business users directly build calculations, they need granular visibility to:
   - Validate their logic works correctly on specific data points
   - Understand calculation behavior on edge cases
   - Make targeted adjustments with confidence
   - Debug issues independently without technical support

3. **Provides LLM Assurance**: As AI generates increasingly complex calculations:
   - Row-level tracing becomes **mandatory** for trust and validation
   - SMEs can verify AI-generated logic on actual data points
   - Immediate feedback loops improve LLM outputs
   - Granular audit trails satisfy both regulatory and risk management needs

4. **Supports Real-Time Analysis**: Organizations can:
   - Trace the impact of changes at individual record level
   - Quickly identify and correct calculation errors
   - Provide detailed explanations to regulators
   - Maintain confidence in rapidly evolving calculations

This capability, built into our wrapped operators, cannot be replicated in any SQL-based tool and represents a significant competitive advantage.
